#Lines with comments start with a # at the beginning of line
#If the symbol # is found in the middle of the line, the rest of the line will be omitted, as it will be considered a comment
#Empty lines will be skipped
#This is an example of user multipath model configuration file.
#This file is for introducing a user defined model for sigma multipath model for a SBAS receiver, which can be elevation or SNR dependent.
#By executing 'gLAB -sigmamultipathfile > usermultipathfile.txt' a valid user multipath model configuration file is created (this file).
#
#The following lines explain the rules for creating this configuration file:
#First line (non empty or without '#') indicates if the following values are for an elevation or S/N ratio model
#Values for first line are: 'Elevation' or 'SNR' (values are case insensitive)
#For example:
#Elevation
#SNR
#
#Values will be given in the same manner for both cases:
#For each line, the first column will be either the elevation or the SNR sample, the second column will be the relevant sigma value for the sample.
#There will be as many lines as the number of available samples.
#Lines must be sorted from lower to higher range values. If lines are not sorted, gLAB will show an error and exit.
#The unit for the samples are:
#  degrees for an elevation dependent model
#  dBHz for a S/N ratio dependent model
#The unit for the sigma values are metres
#Sigma values between intervals will be linearly interpolated
#If a value to be interpolated is below the minimum sample, the minimum sample value will be used. The same criteria will be used for values over the maximum sample.
#Range step does not need to be constant.
#
#If SNR model is selected and no SNR from RINEX is available, the highest SNR sample will be used.
#
#Example for an elevation dependent model:
#Elevation
#20   0.7
#30   0.6
#40   0.5
#60   0.3
#78   0.2
#80   0.1
# 
#Example for a SNR dependent model:
#SNR
#30     0.6
#40 0.5
#56 0.4
#60 0.3
#
#Data columns do not need to have a specific number of spaces between them, as well as leading and trailing spaces at the beginning or end of line respectively are ignored. Furthermore, leading zero for values lower than 1 is optional.
#Data columns may have as column separator white spaces (' '), commas (',') or semicolon (';'). gLAB, internally, will replace all commas and semicolons by spaces, therefore, these column separators can be set combined in different or in the same line.
#Numbers MUST have decimals with a dot ('.'), as commas are treated as a column separator
#For example, this line:
#20   0.5
#Can also be written like this:
#   20        .5
#
Elevation
10  0.8
20      0.7
30  0.6
40  0.5
50  0.4
60  0.3
70  0.2
80  0.1
90  0.1

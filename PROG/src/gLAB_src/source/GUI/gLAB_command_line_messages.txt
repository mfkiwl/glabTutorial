  MESSAGES FORMAT
    INFO
        INFO messages are shown at several points in the program and provide information on the
          program configuration, events and problems it may encounter, which are:

             At the start of the file, showing information about gLAB configuration.
             An inconsistent clock update on the receiver.
             In SBAS processing, a GEO or mode switch.
             In DGNSS processing, a switch from DGNSS to SPP solution mode.
             A change in the a priori receiver coordinates (only when receiver coordinates are computed by gLAB).
             The new position to be used from the reference position file (only when a reference file is provided).
             No solution was computed, along with the reason for not being able to compute the
                 solution (not enough satellites available, singular geometry matrix or GDOP too high).

        The satellite coordinates (fields 11-16) are given in the transmission epoch if the model of the
          signal transmission time is enabled (if it is disabled, they are given in the reception
          time). The coordinates are relative to the antenna phase centre or satellite mass centre,
          depending on the products input:
            * Broadcast: Antenna Phase Centre
            * Precise: Satellite Mass Centre
        Field 9 is the direct measurement (as in the RINEX file), but scaled to metres for carrier phase
          measurements. Field 10 is the model computed for this measurement. Field 10 is the direct sum
          of fields 17 to 28.
        When the '*' appears in field 1, it is due to smoothed code of the satellite has not reached steady-state, a SBAS processing mode switch
          or SBAS GEO switch. When a mode or GEO switch occurs, the SBAS corrections have to be computed again.
        The SNR value in field 31 may be any of these values (in this order): the "S" measurement in the
          observation file, or if it is not present, it will be the SNR flag in the current measurement.
          If no SNR is available, 999 will be printed in this field.

        NOTES:
          If observation file starts at 22 hours or later, gLAB will automatically assume that all the epochs until the start of the next day (midnight)
            are for convergence time. During this convergence time, all the epochs computed will not be taken into account for the summary and
            the Stanford-ESA computation will be skipped. This behaviour can be disabled with the parameter '--summary:waitfordaystart'.
          If receiver position is not fixed or provided by a reference file, the percentile lines will not appear.
          If user provides a reference file for comparing the solution and if at a certain epoch the reference file position is not available,
            the epoch will be skipped from the summary.
          The last line of the summary contains all the values of the previous lines along with the station coordinates.
          If receiver position is not fixed, the station coordinates will be the solution from the last computed epoch.
          The last line is useful for plotting world maps with data from each station.

        NOTES:
          If observation file starts at 22 hours or later, gLAB will automatically assume that all the epochs until the start of the next day (midnight)
            are for convergence time. During this convergence time, all the epochs computed will not be taken into account for the summary and
            the Stanford-ESA computation will be skipped. This behaviour can be disabled with the parameter '--summary:waitfordaystart'.
          If rover position is not provided, the percentile lines will not appear.
          If user provides a reference file for comparing the solution and if at a certain epoch the reference file position is not available,
            the epoch will be skipped from the summary.
          If rover position is not provided, the station coordinates will be the solution from the last computed epoch.
          The last line of the summary contains all the values of the previous lines along with the station coordinates.
          The last line is useful for plotting world maps with data from each station.
          Stanford-ESA messages will not appear if Stanford-ESA computation has not been enabled.
          GDOP messages will not appear if GDOP threshold has not been enabled.
          The lines referring to a reference file will only appear if a user sets a reference file.

    SATDIFF [orbit and clock comparison]
        Satellite difference message for products comparison mode. This message shows the difference between
        both orbit and clocks for two different OC products fonts for a specific time. It is shown each time step.
        The SISRE fields are the Signal-in-Space Range Error, it is a measure of how the error impact a general
        receiver found in the Earth's surface. It is computed as:
            SISRE = sqrt((radDiff-clkDiff)^2 + 1/49*(ctDiff^2 + atDiff^2))
        Being:
            radDiff, the difference of satellite positions in the radial component
            clkDiff, the difference of satellite clock offsets

    -pre:cs:li              Use the carrier phase geometry-free combination (LI) for cycle-slip detection (2 frequencies) [default in PPP]

    --pre:cs:li             Do not use carrier phase geometry-free combination (LI) for cycle-slip detection (2 frequencies) [default in SPP]
                            Li combination is a slow varying function which only has ambiguity and ionosphere
                            Each epoch and satellite an expected LI value is computed and compared against the
                            measured one, if this difference is above a certain threshold, a cycle-slip is marked.
                            This threshold is (max + (min-max)*exp(-dt/t)), being dt the time between epochs

    --pre:cs:bw              Do not use Melbourne-Wubbenna (BW) for cycle-slip detection (2 frequencies) [default in SPP]
                             BW combination is a mixed combination between carrier phase and pseudoranges.
                             This combination is free of ionosphere and geometry, thence constant, but
                             has a high noise (due to the pseudorange measurements used). If this noise is
                             low enough, it is straightforward to detect cycle-slips, but in noisy environments
                             BW is not able to detect cycle-slips. The algorithm using BW computes the mean and
                             the standard deviation of the last epochs in order to obtain an estimated value
                             and the noise level of the combination. The estimated value is compared against the
                             measured value, and the noise level is used for the threshold of this difference.
                             Difference must be lower than standard deviation multiplied by a number (k-factor).
                             This threshold has minimum (min) and maximum (max) saturation values.

    -pre:cs:bw:siginit <val>     Initial standard deviation (in metres) to use in BW after a cycle-slip [default 2]

    -pre:cs:bw:kfactor <val>     Relation between estimated and measured BW values in relation to its standard deviation [default 5]

    -pre:cs:bw:samples <val>     Minimum number of epochs needed to stabilize the mean and sigma in the BW cycle-slip detector [default 2]

    -pre:cs:l1c1                 Use the L1-C1 combination for cycle-slip detection (1 frequency) [default in PPP]

    --pre:cs:l1c1                Do not use the L1-C1 combination for cycle-slip detection (1 frequency) [default in SPP]

    -pre:cs:l1c1:unconcheck      Use the unconsistency check in L1-C1 cycle-slip detection (1 frequency) [default]

    -pre:cs:l1c1:unconcheck:th  <val> Threshold (in metres) for the unconsistency check in L1-C1 cycle-slip detection (1 frequency) [default 20]
                             The L1-C1 averages the difference between carrier phase and pseudorange measurements in F1 for several epochs.
                             This cycle-slip detection method is very useful for single-frequency receivers, as it only requires
                             measurements from one frequency. As a counterpart, the ionospheric term is different for C1 and L1
                             thence, this combination will tend to diverge. It becomes necessary to set a smoothing window
                             to limit this divergence (-pre:cs:l1c1:timewindow). This makes that this method becomes a bit limited
                             with data rates too low. Ideally this method should be used with rates of 1 Hz

     NOTE: When setting any fast, slow, ionosphere correction or their sigmas to 0, gLAB will still check all the conditions
             for the current mode. For example, if gLAB is in PA mode and the '-model:nofastcor' parameter is set, then it
             will search for a fast correction, and if it is available, it will set the value to 0 instead of the one
             given in the SBAS message. If there is no SBAS fast correction available, the satellite will not be used.

     NOTE: The SBAS timeouts given by the user will override the defaults stated in MOPS-D.

  SUMMARY OPTIONS

      When processing in SPP/PPP/SBAS/DGNSS modes, if summary is enabled a statistical summary will be printed
        at the end of the output file. If receiver position is not fixed, error percentiles messages will not be shown
        The options for generating this summary are:

    -summary:percentile  <val>  Sets the value for computing the error percentile [default 95]

    -summary:waitfordaystart   If the observation file starts at 22 hours or later, gLAB will assume that from the first epoch
                                     until epoch 23 hours 59 minutes 59 seconds are given just to fill the messages buffer and wait for
                                     the smoothing and filter to converge, and the following epochs from the next day are the ones of interest.
                                     During this convergence period, Stanford-ESA values will not be computed and they will not be taken into
                                     account for the summary. This option is useful to avoid high error epoch in the summary
                                     during the convergence time. [default on]
                                    This option can be disabled with '--summary:waitfordaystart'
                                    This option will have no effect if '-summary:starttime' is set

    -summary:starttime <date>  Set the first epoch (in GPS time) to be used in the summary. See parameter '-pre:starttime' for details on date format

    -summary:stationnetworkname <name> Sets the station network name to be printed in the last line of summary. This is useful for doing
                                         stations maps with each station network having different marker type, colour or size
                                         with the graphical tool (after merging the last line of the summary of several processed
                                         stations in a single file) [default 'Other']

      NOTE: The last line of the summary contains all the values of the previous lines along with the station coordinates.
            	This line is useful for plotting world maps with data from each station.

      NOTE: An example of a summary can be seen executing gLAB with '-messages' parameter

   ADDITIONAL SUMMARY OPTIONS FOR SBAS
      In SBAS mode, there are additional options for the summary:

    -summary:hal           <val>  Sets the Horizontal Alarm Limit (in metres) for computing availability and continuity risk [default 40]

    -summary:val           <val>  Sets the Vertical Alarm Limit (in metres) for computing availability and continuity risk [default 50]

    -summary:windowsizemar <val>  Sets the fixed window size (in epochs) for computing the continuity risk for maritime
                                    [default 15 for aviation, 900 for maritime]

      NOTE: The computation of the continuity risk takes into account the sampling rate and data gaps in the observation file.

    -sbasplots:hourlymaps      Print the hourly availability maps. The files will have the same name as the daily maps, but with '_HHh' added
                                 before the file extension (being HH the hour with two digits)

    -sbasplots:combdopplot     Compute combined SBAS DOP file with HDOP, PDOP and GDOP plots. This option is automatically set if
                                 '-output:sbascombdopplots' is set. [default off]

    -sbasplots:doppercentile   Enable computation of DOP percentile for DOP maps. Warning: Each DOP map requires around 1GB of memory
                                 (with the default map size) [default off]

    -sbasplots:percentile    <val>  Sets the value for computing the percentile in DOP maps [default 95]
                                     In order to do combined HDOP, PDOP and GDOP plots, SBAS Availability plots must be enabled.

    -sbasplots:exclusionarea <minlon> <maxlon> <minlat> <maxlat>
                               Set a square area where SBAS availability and SBAS iono availability will be set to 0 (the area is skipped during computation)
                                 This is useful when processing large areas (e.g. areas with multiple SBAS and want to exclude the sea between them)
                                 The user can set any number of exclusion area by providing this parameter as many times as necessary
                                 The area must be given with these four values (in this order): minimum longitude, maximum longitude,
                                 minimum latitude, maximum latitude. The four values must be in degrees, with the longitude between -180
                                 and 180 degrees, and the latitude between -90 and 90 degrees

    -sbasplots:inclusionarea <minlon> <maxlon> <minlat> <maxlat>
                               Set a square area where SBAS availability and SBAS iono availability will be computed (the rest is skipped). This area must be
                                 inside the region defined by parameters '-sbasplots:minlon', '-sbasplots:maxlon', '-sbasplots:minlat' and '-sbasplots:maxlat'.
                                 The user can set any number of inclusion area by providing this parameter as many times as necessary
                                 The area must be given with these four values (in this order): minimum longitude, maximum longitude,
                                 minimum latitude, maximum latitude. The four values must be in degrees, with the longitude between -180
                                 and 180 degrees, and the latitude between -90 and 90 degrees

   If both inclusion and exclusion areas are provided, then an area which is processed must be inside of any inclusion area and outside of any exclusion area.
   The default region defined in gLAB corresponds to EGNOS coverage area.
   The available output messages in this mode are INFO [default on], SBASIONO [default off] and SBASUNSEL [default off]
   Most of the options applied for normal SBAS processing can also be applied for this mode, except for those which apply to measurement corrections (due to
     there are none in this mode) and the option to use Klobuchar while solution converges ('-model:initcoordNPA') as we consider we are always in strict PA mode.

   An example of the generated figures with graph program is in the SBAS manual (file gLAB_SBAS_SUM.pdf)

  DATE CONVERSION OPTIONS

      This mode is for converting a date format (in GPS time) to all other GNSS date formats and exit.
      The accepted date formats are: YYYY/MM/DD HH:MM:SS.zzz ('zzz' are milliseconds), Year/DoY/SoD, GPSWeek/SoW, MJDN/SoD (MJDN is Modified Julian Day Number)
      Minimum accepted date is 1980/01/06 (YYYY/MM/DD) or 1980/006 (Year/DoY) or 0/0 (GPSWeek/SoW) or 44244/0 (MJDN/SoD)
      This mode is activated when any of the following parameter is provided:

      This mode is activated when any of the following parameter is provided:

    -coordconv:cartesian <x> <y> <z>
               X, Y and Z coordinates unit is metres.

    -coordconv:geodetic <lon> <lat> <height>

               Longitude is in degrees (range [-180..180]), latitude is in degrees (range [-90..90]) and radius is in metres.


  WORK MODES

    gLAB can work in nine different modes:
        - Positioning Mode: 'Standard' mode, where all the processing is done, and a solution for a
                       receiver is provided as OUTPUT messages. The minimum parameters required for this
                       mode are an input observation file ('-input:obs') and orbit and clock products
                       ('-input:nav', '-input:sp3' or '-input:orb'/'-input:clk'). Using precise products
                       will also require the use of an ANTEX file ('-input:ant'). For SBAS processing, an
                       additional input SBAS file ('-input:sbas') is needed. For DGNSS processing, an
                       additional input file ('-input:dgnss' or '-input:rtcm') is needed

        - Show Input Mode: This mode only reads an input RINEX observation file and print its measurements.
                       The parameter required for this mode is '-input:obs', and specifically, no orbit and
                       clock products should be provided (if provided, gLAB will switch to Positioning Mode)

        - Product Comparison Mode: This mode reads and compares two different sources of orbit and clock products.
                       In order to use this mode, '-input:obs' must be avoided, and two different orbit and clock
                       products should be provided. This mode outputs the SATDIFF, SATSTAT and STASTATTOT messages

        - Show Product Mode: This mode reads a single source of orbit and clock products.
                       In order to use this mode, '-input:obs' must be avoided, and a single orbit and clock
                       product should be provided. This mode output SAT messages

        - Convert mode: Only for SBAS. If the parameter '-onlyconvert' is given, gLAB will just generate a RINEX-B 2.11 or EMS
                       or Pegasus files (depending on the parameters) and it will not process any GNSS data.
                       The minimum parameters for this mode are an SBAS file ('-input:sbas'), the '-onlyconvert' parameter
                       and an output file format ('-output:rinexb', '-output:ems', '-output:pegasus')

        - SBAS Plots Mode: This mode is activated when only a navigation file and a SBAS file are given. In this mode,
                       three plots are computed: SBAS Availability, SBAS Continuity Risk and SBAS Ionosphere Corrections Availability.
                       The three plots are computed in PA mode in the delimited (squared) region and resolution during one day (the Availability and
                       Continuity Risk are computed at a one second rate, while the Ionosphere Corrections Availability is computed at a 300 seconds rate by default).
                       For the three plots the values are computed for a Fault-Free receiver (no data gaps, no cycle-slips).
                       For SBAS Availability plots, an epoch at a given latitude and longitude and height (by default is the WGS84 geoid level -0 metres-)
                         is considered to be available when both the Horizontal and Vertical Protection Levels are below their respective alarm limits.
                       For SBAS Continuity Risk plot, it is computed the probability of having a discontinuity (i.e. no SBAS PA solution) during the
                         next 15 seconds (i.e. using a sliding window of 15 seconds) in aviation mode. In maritime processing, it is followed the
                         IMO (International Maritime Organization) resolution A.1046 (27), which states that there will be only one discontinuity
                         every 15 minutes, so each discontinuity will affect the previous 15 minutes (even if two consecutive discontinuity events
                         occur in less than 15 minutes). See notes for SBAS maritime below.
                       For SBAS Ionosphere Corrections Availability plot, each coordinate in the map is considered as a pierce point at 350 km height,
                         and it is considered as available when a SBAS ionosphere can be computed at the given pierce point.
                       The minimum parameters to activate this mode are the input navigation file ('-input:nav') and the input SBAS message file ('-input:sbas').
                       The output files have to be processed with graph program (with '--sbas' parameter) in order to generate the plots.
                       The available output messages in this mode are INFO [default on], SBASIONO [default off] and SBASUNSEL [default off].
                       NOTE: With the default configuration, the computation time is around 2 hours. Increasing resolution or map size
                              will significantly increase computation time.

        - Add User Error to RINEX: This mode reads a RINEX observation file, a user added error file and creates a new RINEX observation file
                       with the same header, version and number of measurements, but the measurements have the user error added into them.
                       This mode is enabled by providing only and observation file and a user added error file with the parameters
                       '-input:obs' and '-input:usererror'
        - Date Conversion: When '-dateconv:calendar' or '-dateconv:doy' or '-dateconv:gpsweek' or '-dateconv:mjdn' are provided, gLAB will read the date
                       from user input and convert it to all other date formats, print them in screen and exit.

        - Coordinate Conversion: When '-coordconv:cartesian' or '-coordconv:geodetic' or '-coordconv:spherical' are provided, gLAB will read the coordinates
                       from user input and convert it to all other coordinate systems, print them in screen and exit.

  NOTES FOR PEGASUS OUTPUT FORMAT

     Pegasus is a GNSS data processing tool from Eurocontrol. Pegasus does not read the RINEX-B or EMS SBAS files, it converts them to columnar text
       files and later processes with these text files. Each text file contains one message type -except for fast correction messages, which are all
       grouped in the same file; and the GEO navigation data, which is RINEX 2 format-.
       Each columnar text file has a header line with the name of each value, and the values are printed in decimal format.
       A full explanation of the Pegasus format can be found in appendixes I.5-I.16 in their ICD at http://www.icao.int/Meetings/AMC/MA/2004/GNSS/icd.pdf

  NOTES FOR PREPROCESSING

     Pseudorange Jumps:
       Some receivers, after updating the clock, they adjust the code but not the carrier phase measurement, producing a jump in the code
         but not in the carrier phase. Therefore, code and carrier phase are not consistent (the difference between code and
         carrier phase is not continuous). If the carrier phase is not adjusted, it will detected as a cycle-slip.

  NOTES FOR SBAS PROCESSING

    When processing with SBAS corrections, gLAB will use MOPS-D standard values and configuration by default.
    Most of these parameters and configuration can be modified by the user, regardless if these parameters are MOPS compliant or not.
    The specific SBAS parameters that can be modified by the user are:
        Smoothing:       Can be disabled or changed the number of epochs [default 100 epochs]
        Steady-state:    Can be disabled or changed the number of epochs [default 360 epochs]
        Ionosphere:      Any ionosphere model available in gLAB (e.g. IONEX) can be applied instead of the SBAS ionosphere model.
        Time outs:       Time outs for all corrections can be user defined
        Mode switch:     Switching from PA to NPA can be enabled or disabled [default disabled]
        GEO switch:      GEO switching can be enabled or disabled [default disabled]. Furthermore, after a GEO switch,
                         the user can decide if to stay in the new GEO or try to fallback to the initial GEO when possible.
        Decimation:      gLAB can process at any data rate. In order to keep integrity of results with 1Hz SBAS data rate,
                            messages will be read every second, and special events will be handled every second.
                            The special events are: receive an alarm message or an UDREI>=14, miss 4 consecutive messages
                            or receive 4 consecutive messages with wrong CRC. Decimation is useful for studying slow
                            varying corrections, such as long term corrections or ionosphere.
        Navigation:      Both kinematic and static navigation mode can be selected. Default is kinematic.

    Mode and GEO switch notes:
      If both mode and GEO switch are enabled, GEO switch is tried first always, as switching GEO keeps PA mode.
      If option '-model:geofallback' is enabled, gLAB will try to switch to the first GEO used in processing after
        the time between switches (defined by parameter '-model:switchtime') after a GEO switch occurs.
      If option '-model:maintaingeo' is enabled gLAB will maintain the current GEO (independently if it was selected
        by the user or by a GEO switch) during all the processing while it can provide a PA solution.
      If both options '-model:maintaingeo' and '-model:geofallback' are enabled, '-model:geofallback' option behaviour will prevail.
      If both options '-model:maintaingeo' and '-model:geofallback' are disabled, after a GEO switch, gLAB will try to switch
        to the previous GEO independently if it was the first one used or not. If there are only two GEOs available (and the use of mixed GEO
        data is disabled), this behaviour is equivalent as in the '-model:geofallback' option, due to the previous GEO will be always the first GEO used.

    Selection of best GEO:
      When option '-model:selectbestgeo' is enabled, gLAB will compute in each epoch the full SBAS model and the protection levels with
        all the GEOs available, and then select the best GEO according to the following criteria:
           1 - Select the GEOs which have PA solution with protection levels under the alarm limits, and from these ones, select
                 the GEO whose sum of the horizontal and vertical protection levels is smaller.

           2 - If no GEOs had PA solution with protection levels under the alarm limits, select the GEOs with PA solution
                 and then select the GEO whose sum of the horizontal and vertical protection levels is smaller.

           3 - If no GEOs had PA solution, select the GEOs with NPA solution and then select the GEO whose sum of the
                 horizontal and vertical protection levels is smaller.

      This option will noticeably increase computation load, especially if there are many GEOs in the SBAS data file.
      If INFO messages are enabled (option '-print:info'), an INFO message with the epoch, GEO PRN and its protection levels will
        be printed for each iteration that provided a solution. The unselected iteration will have a '(Not selected)' text to indicate
        that it was not selected. The selected iteration will be printed last, with the text '(Selected)'.
      If option '-print:sbasunused' is enabled, the 'MODEL', 'SBASCORR', 'SBASVAR', 'SBASUNSEL' and 'SATSEL' messages for each discarded
        iteration will be printed. All messages from discarded iterations will have an '*' next to message name to indicate it was discarded.
        The iterations without solution will be printed first, and the last ones printed will be the iterations discarded but had solution.
      If selection of best GEO is set, the options '-model:switchgeo' will be automatically set. Moreover, option '-model:switchtime'
        must be set to 0 (if not set, it will be automatically set to 0), as in an epoch multiple GEO changes will be done, and also
         option '' must be disabled.

    SBAS Maritime mode:
      Maritime mode is a special configuration for SBAS. In this configuration, message type 10 (degradation parameters), type 27 (service message)
        and type 28 (clock ephemeris covariance matrix) are not used. Therefore, the sigma of fast and long term corrections is computed with the
        following formula:

                      Sigmaflt = SigmaUDRE + 8 (all units are in metres)

      Alarm limits in maritime mode are not used (in gLAB alarm limits cannot be disabled, so they are set to 100Km), and a filter for
        HDOP (Horizontal Dilution of Precision) and PDOP (Position Dilution of Precision). A valid epoch must have a HDOP<4 or a PDOP<6 (it only
        needs to fulfill one of these two conditions).
      Furthermore, for maritime mode, another mode for computing the continuity risk is used. Instead of a sliding windows of 15 seconds, it is used
        a fixed window of 15 minutes (900 seconds). That is, every time a discontinuity event occurs, it will affect the previous 15 minutes, independently
        if there had been a discontinuity within the previous 15 minutes (where as in aviation mode, each discontinuity only affects
        the last seconds until the previous discontinuity -up to the window size-). This is an optimistic computation of the continuity risk, but
        maritime mode has more relaxed requirements, as seen above. If desired, the user can change the size of the 15 minute window to any value.
        The disadvantages of this mode of continuity risk computation are that if several discontinuities occur in a time span smaller than the
        window size (which usually happens in the SBAS coverage border), then epochs with discontinuities may be counted more than one, which may
        do that the continuity risk ends up being greater than 1 (this effect can be mitigated by using large time spans). The other disadvantage is that
        if some discontinuities occur but each of them have a duration larger than the window size, the total continuity risk will be much smaller compared
        to the aviation continuity risk, as only the epochs of the size of the window will be counted for the discontinuity, but the other epochs in a
        discontinuity but greater than the window will not be counted. This effect is also maximized as the continuity risk is computed using the
        number of epochs processed, not the number of epochs with solution in PA mode.
        The formula to compute the maritime continuity risk is:

              Maritime Continuity Risk = CTI/MTBF = Window_Size/(NumEpochsProcessed/NumDiscontinuities) = Window_Size*NumDiscontinuities/NumEpochsProcessed

          Where:
           CTF: Continuity Time Interval, which is the window size
           MTBF: Mean Time Between Failures, which is computed as the total epochs processed divided by the number of discontinuities

        This formula is from IALA (International Association of Marine Aids to Navigation and Lighthouse Authorities), available in the following document:
           http://www.iala-aism.org/product/performance-and-monitoring-of-dgnss-services-in-the-frequency-band-283-5-325khz-1112/
      Maritime mode is configured with parameter '-model:sbasmaritime', which is a shortcut for providing these parameters: '-model:nomt10',
         '-model:nomt2728', '-model:geoswitch', '-filter:maxhdop 4', '-filter:maxpdop 6', '-filter:hdoporpdop', '-summary:hal 100000',
         '-summary:val 100000', '-summary:windowsize 900' and '-summary:windowsizemar 900'.
         Furthermore, parameter '-model:sbasmaritime' will also set maritime options in SBAS plots mode.

  NOTES FOR DOP MAPS:

      When computing the mean and percentile in DOP maps, since version 5.4.0, only the epochs whose protection levels are below the
         alarm limits are used. In version 5.3.0, any epoch with solution, independently of the protection levels, was always taken
         into account for the mean and percentile computation. In this case, if an epoch had a very big DOP (e.g. more than 1 million),
         this value (a clear outlier) would totally bias the mean value to a higher value.

  NOTES FOR SBAS PLOTS:

      See option '-sbasplotsinfo' for detailed help on how to generate SBAS plots.

  NOTES FOR PREFIT OUTLIER DETECTION

      There are two prefit outlier detectors in gLAB:
       - Prefit outlier detector comparing against the median (by default disabled):
          The procedure for this detector is:
           Compute the median of all prefits
           For each satellite:
              Compute absolute value of the difference between the prefit and the median
              If the difference is higher than the threshold, unselect the satellite

       - Prefit outlier detector comparing the absolute values (by default disabled):
          The procedure for this detector is:
           For each satellite available:
             Compute the absolute value of its prefit (ReferencePrefit)
             Set a range for all other satellite prefits defined as:
                Range=[abs(ReferencePrefit)-threshold,abs(ReferencePrefit)+threshold]
                For each satellite (except the reference one):
                  Check if prefits are inside the range
                If half or more of the satellites are unvalid, then the current satellite is an outlier
                Else discard the satellites with prefits outside the range.

       If receiver position is fixed, gLAB will allow the outlier detector to discard all satellites in the current epoch.

       If receiver position is not fixed, if more than half of the available satellites are discarded, then, the prefit outlier detector
          will not discard any satellite, as it will assume that the solution still has to converge.

       A recommended value for the thresholds of the prefit outlier detectors is 30 metres

  NOTES FOR DGNSS PROCESSING

    Sigma inflation: During the transient period until the smoother converges, the measurement noise sigma is inflated according
                     to the next equation:
                       Sigma_inflat= f(n)/f(Nstdy) * sigma
                            n<N    f(n)=sqrt(1/n)
                            n>=N   f(n)=sqrt(1/(2*N-1)*(1+((N-1)/N)^(2*(n-N)+1)))
                          where:
                            n:     number of processed samples
                            N:     number of samples of the smoothing window
	                        Nstdy: number of samples when reaching the steady state: In gLAB, Nstdy=(int)(3.6*N)
	                  For instance, with 1 second sampling rate and N=100, the stationary state (Nstdy) is assumed to be reached after 360 seconds
